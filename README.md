# Features

- This is an Obsidian plugin to create and name new note files using the zettelkasten method. You can choose to create a child or sibling note of an opening note. For example, with an opening note named "a3a", selecting  "New sibbling note" will create a new file named "a3b", and selecting  "New child note" will create a file named a3a1. However, this plugin does not currently work with .canvas files.
